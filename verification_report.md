# Verification Report: GalvanizliTelNetsis Component

## Summary
The GalvanizliTelNetsis component fixes have been successfully implemented. The ESLint check passed without errors, confirming no syntax issues in the updated code.

## Key Implementations Verified

1. **API Endpoint Fix:**
   - Changed API endpoint from 'gal_cost_cal_sal_requests' to 'gal_sal_requests' to fix the talepler (requests) section.

2. **YM ST Auto Calculate Implementation:**
   - Added `handleAutoCalculateYmSt` function (lines 18-58) that correctly sets fire_orani to 3 and miktar to 1.03.
   - Added UI button for auto-calculation in the YmSt list display.

3. **1-1-1 Model Implementation:**
   - Updated `handleSaveToDatabase` function (lines 61-231) to properly create a new MM GT for each YM ST.
   - Implemented sequential numbering for MM GT codes.
   - Added proper error handling and progress notifications during save operations.

4. **Excel Format Updates:**
   - Modified `createReceteExcel` function (lines 307-1062) to generate:
     - Exactly 8 rows for MM GT REÇETE
     - Exactly 4 rows for YM GT REÇETE, excluding SM.DESİ.PAK and GTPKT01
     - Exactly 2 rows per YM ST for YM ST REÇETE
   - Added proper formatting and styling for Excel sheets.

5. **Status Indicators for YM ST:**
   - Added `renderYmStList` function (lines 1068-1108) with visual indicators showing:
     - Whether the YM ST was fetched from database or generated
     - Whether the YM ST has a recipe

6. **Auto Calculate Button in Reçete Edit:**
   - Added `renderReceteEditHeader` function (lines 1112-1162) with "Otomatik Hesapla" button.
   - Implemented logic to calculate recipes for all YM STs at once.

## All Requirements Met
