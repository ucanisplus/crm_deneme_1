# Frontend Maintenance Documentation

## CORS Fix and Backend Separation

The frontend and backend code have been properly separated, with the backend living in its own repository at `crm_deneme_backend-main`.

### Changes Made

1. **Removed Backend Files from Frontend**:
   - Removed: CORS_FIX_README.md, cors_fixed_index.js, fixed_backend_index.js, minimal_backend.js, updated_cors_config.js, cors-test.html, debug-network.js, documentation/CORS_Fix_Documentation.md

2. **Retained Required Frontend Files**:
   - Kept: lib/timestamp-fix.js (contains utilities for frontend-side data processing)
   - Kept: api-config.js (contains API endpoint URLs)

3. **Created Stub Files for Compatibility**:
   - Created stub versions of:
     - `lib/cors-proxy.js` - Simplified version that maintains API compatibility but uses direct fetch
     - `debug-network.js` - Simplified version that maintains API compatibility but disables debugging

### Email Notifications

Email notifications are now properly implemented in the backend with CORS support. The frontend sends email requests to:
`https://crm-deneme-backend.vercel.app/api/send-email-notification`

### Future Improvements

1. **Complete Removal of Stubs**:
   Future versions should gradually remove dependencies on:
   - cors-proxy.js 
   - debug-network.js
   
   These files are kept as stubs for compatibility but should be phased out.

2. **API Standardization**:
   All API calls should use the standardized API_URLS from api-config.js and the fetchWithAuth helper.
